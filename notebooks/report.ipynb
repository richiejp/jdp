    "# Test Results Review Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This is supposed to help create the milestone report for now and eventuall generate it automatically. It is an interactive Jupyter document (or a static view of such a document) containing Julia code segments and their output. It is part of the JDP project which aims to create an *easily accessible* system for exploring test results and automating *arbitrary* workflows. Notebooks such as these are intended to provide an easy starting point for engineers and other technical users to create their own reports, possibly just by tweaking the existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually this workbook should be easily installable locally or accessible from some remote location with zero knowledge of Julia or Jupyter. However right now it is not, but you can still try by visiting: https://github.com/richiejp/jdp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously you can also access the library from a REPL or use it in a traditional script or application, but Jupyter provides a nice, persistent, graphical environment. I won't discuss how to use Jupyter in this notebook (just click on help at the top), but will heavily annotate the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to load the JDP library which does the heavy lifting; importing and transforming the test result data from OpenQA into something useable. Note that this assumes you started this notebook by running `julia src/notebook.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: It is required that you run this cell before the code cells following it. However not all of the cells need to be executed in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see a bunch of horrible angry red text when running this. Unfortunately this could either be info messages or error messages from the logging system, Jupyter treats both to a red background."
