    "This is a *prototype* for a HPC test results report. It is part of the [JDP](https://rpalethorpe.io.suse.de/jdp/) project. This report is created using Jupyter and Julia, for details see the (highly annotated) general [kernel group report](https://rpalethorpe.io.suse.de/jdp/reports/Report-DataFrames.html).\n",

    "So far I have just included a test results matrix and no information about which test failures have been tagged with a bug or what that bug is. Nor have I included any test error messages or links to the failing module in OpenQA. In theory any information can be added although some things will require changes to the JDP library which will take time.\n",
