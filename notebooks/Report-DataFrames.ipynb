    "# Test Results Review Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This is supposed to help create the milestone QA acceptance report. It is an interactive Jupyter document (or a static view created by [Weave](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl/)) containing Julia code segments and their output. It is part of the JDP project which aims to create an *easily accessible* system for exploring test results and automating *arbitrary* workflows. Notebooks such as these are intended to provide an easy starting point for engineers and other technical users to create their own reports, possibly just by tweaking the existing ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "Obviously you can also access the library from a REPL or use it in a traditional script or application, but Jupyter provides a nice, persistent, graphical environment. I won't discuss how to use Jupyter in this notebook (just click on help at the top), but will heavily annotate the code.\n",
